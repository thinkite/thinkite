/**
 * Chat surface: virtualized transcript list + sticky composer
 * (GitStatusBar + InputBar) above the keyboard, plus the
 * composer-inset wiring that keeps the last message visible above the
 * composer no matter how it grows or the keyboard toggles.
 *
 * Mounted only in the parent's `ready` branch (loading / error
 * render their own placeholders) — the whole chat surface mounts and
 * unmounts as a unit per session. That single boundary fixes a chain
 * of issues we hit while iterating:
 *
 *   1. `initialScrollAtEnd` always sees non-empty data on first
 *      commit. The list relies on a per-frame rAF ticker to retarget
 *      to true end as items measure; that needs non-empty data to
 *      have somewhere to land. (Before: list mounted under
 *      ListEmptyComponent with data=[] during loading, retarget never
 *      fired, last message stayed hidden behind composer until user
 *      toggled keyboard.)
 *
 *   2. The composer-inset SharedValue (via `useKeyboardChatComposerInset`) is
 *      measured from the composer wrapper in a mount-time useLayoutEffect
 *      (before paint) and reported as the list's bottom inset; see the call
 *      site for the seed history.
 *
 *   3. KeyboardChatScrollView vs. iOS automatic contentInset
 *      adjustments: must disable both
 *      `contentInsetAdjustmentBehavior` and
 *      `automaticallyAdjustContentInsets`. Per the
 *      react-native-keyboard-controller chat-app guide, iOS's
 *      automatic adjustments double-count safe area against KCSV's
 *      own management. (Before: visible clipping under composer of
 *      ~insets.bottom = the home-indicator zone.) Side effect: iOS
 *      no longer auto-pads the top either, so we manually apply
 *      `style={{ paddingTop: headerHeight }}` to keep content from
 *      starting under the transparent Stack.Header. Both ends become
 *      our responsibility once auto-adjust is off.
 *
 *   4. The list's `keyboardOffset` mirrors `KeyboardStickyView.offset.opened`
 *      (both `insets.bottom - 8`): with the keyboard up it drops the
 *      safe-area band baked into the inset (via the composer's `pb-safe`)
 *      and leaves the last message ~8pt above the keyboard top. Without it
 *      the last message sits a touch low above the composer.
 *
 * Per-session lifecycle: because this whole surface mounts fresh per
 * session (the detail screen swaps it on the loading→ready transition),
 * `initialScrollAtEnd`, the composer-inset measurement, the KCSV keyboard
 * scroll-state, and the daemon live-fanout registration all start clean on
 * every switch — no cross-mount state to reset by hand. (A persistent
 * ChatPanel was tried and removed: it saved the mount cost but left
 * LegendList/KCSV's per-mount keyboard + scroll state stale across
 * switches, which couldn't be re-seeded from outside the wrapper.)
 *
 * Trade-off: brief no-composer flash during the loading transition
 * (typically <300ms for an in-flight subscribe). Mirror of how
 * Claude Desktop / ChatGPT handle session-switch loading — input is
 * hidden until the session is ready to receive it.

            laid out above the composer: it rides keyboard transitions for
            free, and staying within the KSV's bounds keeps it tappable

            of `composerRef`, so it doesn't inflate the measured list
