/**
 * (drawer)/(stack)/index — new-session create page, URL `/`. Lives inside
 * the same Stack as the detail screen so it inherits the native UIKit
 * UINavigationBar (iOS 26 Liquid Glass) via Stack.Header / Stack.Toolbar.
 *
 * Sibling-of-detail layout means the "+ New" sidebar action and "tap a
 * session row" action both translate to `router.replace` within the same
 * Stack — no drawer-screen swap, no inner-Stack remount, no flicker. The
 * `(stack)` group is invisible in URLs, so this page is just `/`, not
 * `/session` — cold launch lands here directly.
 *
 * cwd selection precedence:
 *   1. `lastUsedCwd` (SecureStore) — what the user picked or opened
 *      most recently on THIS device. Set on session-row tap (sidebar)
 *      and on send below.
 *   2. `recentCwds[0]` from daemon `getFilesystemRoots` — server's
 *      best guess across all activity, used as the initial bootstrap
 *      default before the user has picked anything on this device.
 *   3. `undefined` — first launch with no session history. GitStatusBar
 *      shows a "Select a project" placeholder + chevron; tap opens the
 *      cwd picker. Send button stays disabled until cwd resolves.
 *
 * Flow on first send:
 *   1. Generate a fresh UUIDv4 client-side
 *   2. `createSession(...)` — its onMutate optimistically inserts the
 *      session row (so the sidebar + detail screen show it, with a title,
 *      immediately), and its mutationFn fires the first sendPrompt +
 *      reconciles via refetch
 *   3. `router.replace("/session/[id]")` immediately — the detail screen
 *      reads the just-inserted row via its own filtered live query
 *
 * The first sendPrompt fires HERE (not deferred to the detail screen)
 * because the daemon seeds an empty settled snapshot for a freshly-created
 * query — so the synthesized user_message + turn_started are recovered via
 * ring-buffer replay whenever the detail screen subscribes, regardless of
 * order. (Previously this was deferred to ChatPanel's first-send effect to
 * dodge the cursor race window; the daemon-side seed removes that need.)
