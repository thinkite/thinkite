/**
 * Nested Stack for the auth-gated app surface. Lives inside the
 * `(main)` route group so the root layout can anchor the `/pair`
 * modal to a route name that's ALWAYS accessible — `(main)` itself —
 * without leaking unpaired-vs-paired logic up to the root.
 *
 * Without this layer the anchor had to be either `onboarding` or
 * `(drawer)`, and whichever it was got blocked by Stack.Protected in
 * the opposite state — when that happened the formSheet couldn't
 * find a background to mount on and silently degraded to a fullscreen
 * card. Hoisting the gating one level down sidesteps that.
 *
 * URL paths are unchanged — route groups (parenthesized folders) are
 * URL-transparent in expo-router. `/onboarding`, `/settings`, the `/dev/*`
 * probes and the drawer routes all stay at the same paths.
