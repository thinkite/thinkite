/**
 * Pure derivation for the context-window meter. Lives in `lib/`
 * alongside `timeline-reducer.ts` (same convention: framework-free
 * logic in lib/, React-Query / RN consumers in hooks/). The hook in
 * `hooks/use-context-usage.ts` is a thin wrapper that joins this with
 * the daemon's model catalog.
 *
 * Formula matches Claude Code's `/context` command:
 *   `used = input_tokens + cache_creation_input_tokens + cache_read_input_tokens`
 *   `output_tokens` is excluded — it's what got appended to the
 *   conversation; only what was sent IN counts against the window.
 *
 * Cache reads count toward "used" because they still occupy context
 * window — they're just billed cheaper than fresh input. Mirrors
 * Claude Code source `analyzeContext.ts`'s `totalFromAPI` calculation.
 *
 * `null` returns: any missing piece (no usage, no model cap, zero
 * used) → meter renders nothing. Distinct from `{ percentage: 0 }`
 * which would render a hairline empty fill.
