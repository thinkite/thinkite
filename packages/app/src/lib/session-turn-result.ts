/**
 * Per-session "latest turn result" — the transcript-derived bits that
 * are NOT a timeline item and are NOT cheap for the daemon to broadcast
 * for every session:
 *   - `latestUsage` — token usage from the last completed turn → the
 *     context-window meter on the composer's model chip.
 *   - `lastError`   — last turn failure string, for dev logging.
 * Keyed by cliSessionId.
 *
 * Why NOT folded into the #17 `sessionStateCollection`: that collection
 * is a daemon-pushed custom-sync collection (its rows are OWNED by the
 * subscribeSessions sync handler — a client patch would be clobbered on
 * the next daemon push, and a bare mutation on a custom-sync collection
 * isn't even allowed). And these two fields are inherently PER-OPEN-
 * SESSION: `latestUsage` needs the transcript (the daemon doesn't cheaply
 * know every session's usage without reading each JSONL) and only the
 * open composer consumes it — the drawer list shows no meter. So they're
 * sourced lazily from the live transcript subscription
 * (transcript-collection-factory routes `turn_completed.usage` /
 * `turn_failed.error` / cold-path `initialUsage` here) into this localOnly
 * collection.
 *
 * Running-state ("is this session working right now") is deliberately NOT
 * here — that's the daemon-authoritative `sessionState.activity` (#17),
 * which is cheap + daemon-wide. Read `activity === "running"` off the
 * `sessionStateCollection` row instead (this used to carry a redundant
 * client-derived `isRunning`; deleted 2026-06-01).
 *
 * A `localOnly` collection — pure in-memory, no external sync source.
 * Interim limitation: rows are only fresh while the feeding transcript
 * subscription is alive. Leaving a session gc's its transcript (~60s),
 * after which its row is cleared (`clearSessionTurnResult`) rather than
 * left frozen.
