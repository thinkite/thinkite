/**
 * BridgeService — daemon-level owner of all CCR bridge mirrors.
 *
 * One instance per daemon process (created in index.ts's `start`, drained in
 * `daemon.stop`). It holds:
 *   - the single OAuthRefreshManager (the keychain token is process-global →
 *     one manager serves every bridge — see project_sidecode_ccr_architecture)
 *   - a `sessionId → AttachedSession` map of live mirrors (M3.5: each entry
 *     tracks transport + runtime + original request + proactive jwt timer)
 *
 * Responsibilities:
 *   - `attach(sessionId, runtime, params)` — open a BridgeTransport, hang it
 *     on `runtime.bridge`, wire the inbound bag, arm the M3.5 proactive jwt
 *     refresh timer, and persist the M3.1 worker state.
 *   - `reconnect(sessionId)` — M3.5.3 unified entry for PROACTIVE
 *     (jwt-timer-driven) and REACTIVE (post-onClose) recovery. Single SDK
 *     probe call (`fetchRemoteCredentials`) is the discriminator (mirrors
 *     Claude Code's own pattern — no close-code switch needed; see
 *     project_sidecode_ccr_architecture onClose-codes spike).
 *   - `detach(sessionId)` — explicit unbridge, cancels timer, closes transport,
 *     clears worker state.
 *   - `shutdown()` — close every mirror + stop the OAuth manager + cancel
 *     every pending timer. Called from daemon.stop() AFTER
 *     runtimeManager.shutdown() (queries drained first).
 *
 * Recovery model (M3.5):
 *   - PROACTIVE: `armProactiveRefresh` schedules ~30min before jwt expiry
 *     (`expiresInSec - proactiveRefreshLeadSec`). Timer fires → calls
 *     `reconnect(sessionId)` → live `transport.reconnect()`. Re-arms on
 *     success.
 *   - REACTIVE: SDK's onClose callback routes through `handleClose` which
 *     dispatches to `reconnect(sessionId)` for any non-1000 code. Dead
 *     transport path: fetch fresh creds + build a NEW attachBridgeSession
 *     against the same cse_, replace transport in session map.
 *   - Same `reconnect` entry serves both. Discriminator is
 *     `transport.isConnected` (live = proactive swap, dead = full re-attach).
 *
 * Ownership boundary: BridgeService owns the transport lifetime, NOT the query
 * loop. run-query's finally clears query/inputChannel/loopPromise but
 * deliberately leaves `runtime.bridge` intact — a bridge outlives an idle
 * (lazy) query (the multiplex invariant). So `runtime.bridge` is a mirror of
 * what this service tracks; the service is the source of truth for closing.
 *
 * Scope today (M2 + M3.1 + M3.5): the daemon constructs ONE BridgeService with
 * the inbound handlers wired (see index.ts) — bidirectional from the first
 * attach. RPC surface for creating bridged sessions / upgrading existing ones
 * to bridged (the "create-bridged" / "upgrade" iOS commands) is still M4;
 * M1.5 + M2.5 spikes call `attach` directly to prove the transport works
 * end-to-end. M3.4 startup re-attach will reuse the `existingCseSessionId` +
 * `initialSequenceNum` BridgeTransport.attach params that M3.5 added.

   * Unified reconnect entry — M3.5.3. Single public method for both

   * Dispatches internally on `transport.isConnected`:
   *
   *   - LIVE transport (proactive jwt swap before expiry) →
   *     `transport.reconnect(creds)` rebuilds internals in place; handle ref
   *     stays the same, runtime.bridge unchanged, SSE resumes from the SDK's
   *     internal high-water mark.
   *
   *   - DEAD transport (post-onClose recovery) → `attachTransport` with
   *     `existingCseSessionId` + `initialSequenceNum = transport.getSequenceNum()`
   *     (the most-recent seq the old handle saw, more current than the disk
   *     checkpoint). Old transport is forgotten, new one replaces it in the
   *     session map, runtime.bridge is re-wired.
   *
   * The discriminator for "session still alive vs deleted" is the return
   * value of `fetchRemoteCredentials` — NOT the onClose code (which is
   * ambiguous: 4090 fires for archive / delete / real epoch supersede; see
   * onClose-codes spike in project_sidecode_ccr_architecture). This mirrors
   * Claude Code's own `handleTransportPermanentClose` pattern — let the
   * recovery attempt's own response decide.
   *
   * Errors PROPAGATE (caller handles backoff in M3.5.6). Returns the result
   * so callers / tests can distinguish reconnected vs cleared vs failed.
