/**
 * Fold one EventDelta into the in-memory `settled` TimelineItem[] (mutating
 * in place, returning the same reference). This is the daemon-side mirror
 * of the iOS transcript reducer (transcript-collection-factory `onEvent`):
 * both apply the SAME deltas the SAME way, so the daemon's cold-path
 * snapshot (`settled`) is exactly what iOS shows live — which lets the
 * turn-boundary refresh stay purely in-memory (no JSONL re-read, no
 * dependency on the SDK's async flush timing, no live/settled divergence).
 *
 * Compact (`compact_started` / `compact_applied`) is a deliberate no-op:
 * the iOS reducer no-ops it too in V0 (divider + prune deferred to V0.5+,
 * see sidecodeapp/sidecode#13). Mirroring that keeps settled == live. A
 * re-read of the compacted JSONL would instead PRUNE settled and diverge
 * from iOS's unpruned live state. When V0.5+ teaches the iOS reducer to
 * prune on `compact_applied` (filter to preservedUuids + append divider),
 * teach this the same prune — still in-memory, still no re-read.
 *
 * Mirrors normalize.ts's output for non-compact turns: the deltas are
 * emitted by run-query using the same tool-detail.ts formatting normalize
 * uses, so a folded item is byte-identical to the normalized one (an
 * append'd tool_call patched to completed == normalize's paired
 * ToolCallItem; append'd-empty assistant_message + patch_text deltas ==
 * normalize's full assistant text).
