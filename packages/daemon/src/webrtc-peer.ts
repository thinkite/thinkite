/**
 * WebRTC-DataChannel transport with **DTLS-fingerprint-pinned identity**.
 *
 * Identity binding lives at the DTLS layer instead of in an application-
 * layer handshake:
 *
 *   1. Daemon creates offer; SDP contains an ephemeral DTLS cert
 *      fingerprint.
 *   2. Daemon signs that fingerprint under a domain tag with its long-
 *      lived Ed25519 key and forwards { sdp, fpSig } via signaling.
 *   3. Client (knowing daemon's pubkey from the QR) verifies fpSig
 *      against the fingerprint in the received SDP. A malicious signaling
 *      worker swapping the fingerprint is caught here, BEFORE DTLS even
 *      starts.
 *   4. Client mirrors the same fp-sign step in its answer.
 *   5. Daemon verifies the answer signature against the client's known
 *      pubkey (looked up in `known_clients.json` via the pubkey the
 *      client self-declared on the signaling side).
 *   6. DTLS handshake completes — the session is now bound to identities
 *      verified out-of-band (QR for daemon → client, pair flow for
 *      client → daemon).
 *   7. DataChannel opens. Frames received from this point are implicitly
 *      from the authenticated peer.
 *   8. Wire-version handshake: client sends `hello`, daemon validates
 *      protocol-version overlap and responds with `server_info`, then
 *      application commands are dispatched to `commandHandler`.
 *
 * Pair-window admission (admitting a new client pubkey to known_clients)
 * is gated by `isPairing` — when true, unknown pubkeys are admitted; when
 * false, they're silently rejected. The menubar UI controls this gate
 * via its `createPairOffer` cadence; tests pre-pair via `knownClients.add()`.
