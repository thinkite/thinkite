/**
 * Drive the SDK's `query()` in **streaming-input mode** — one persistent
 * subprocess per session, fed user prompts via an async channel. Each
 * emitted SDK message becomes an `EventDelta` pushed into the runtime's
 * ring buffer.
 *
 * Why streaming-input (vs single-shot string `prompt: string`):
 *   - SDK's `interrupt()` only works in streaming mode (per
 *     sdk.d.ts:2018-2027). Single-shot prompts would leave F3's "stop"
 *     button dead.
 *   - One subprocess per session → no 1-2s respawn + context reload per
 *     turn.
 *   - Matches Paseo's pattern (claude-agent.ts:2109-2113).
 *
 * Public API:
 *   - `ensureSessionLoop(runtime, options)` — idempotent; lazy-creates
 *     the channel, query, and consumer loop on first call. Returns the
 *     loop's promise (resolves when query exits via close / error /
 *     natural end). Subsequent calls return the existing promise.
 *   - `pushPrompt(runtime, text)` — pushes a user message into the
 *     channel. Throws if no loop is running yet.
 *
 * Consumer-loop behavior — what each SDK message becomes:
 *   - `stream_event` (with `includePartialMessages: true` set):
 *       - `message_start` → remember Anthropic message.id
 *       - `content_block_start (text)` → `append { assistant_message }`
 *         with empty text under synthetic uuid `${msgId}:${blockIndex}`
 *       - `content_block_delta (text_delta)` → `patch_text` against
 *         that synthetic uuid
 *       - `content_block_*` for tool_use / `input_json_delta` → IGNORED.
 *         V0 waits for the `assistant` envelope (which carries the full
 *         input) and emits the running tool_call atomically. Partial-JSON
 *         input streaming is deferred (see project_session_replay_model
 *         memory and Paseo's claude-agent.ts:3918 for V0.5+ adoption).
 *
 *   - `assistant` envelope: each `tool_use` block (deduped by call id)
 *     becomes `append { tool_call, status: "running", detail }`.
 *
 *   - `user` envelope: each `tool_result` block patches the matching
 *     pending tool_call → `patch_tool_call { status, error, detail }`.
 *
 *   - everything else (system / status / hook / result / replay): ignored.
 *
 * Identifier divergence between live and settled state is documented in
 * the protocol's `eventDelta` doc — synthetic `${msgId}:${idx}` for live
 * assistant_message uuids vs envelope uuid for cold-start. They never
 * coexist in the iOS view, so the divergence is acceptable for V0.

/**
 * Mirror one raw SDKMessage to the CCR bridge, if this runtime is bridged.
 *
 * Parallel derivation to handleSdkMessage's enriched EventDelta fan-out:
 * the SAME query() stream forks into (a) enriched → WebRTC and (b) raw →
 * bridge → claude.ai. One tap, two sinks — no conversion between them.
 *
 * Forwarding is an ALLOWLIST that mirrors Claude Code's own
 * `isEligibleBridgeMessage` (claude-code-source bridge/bridgeMessaging.ts) —
 * "the server only wants user/assistant turns and slash-command system
 * events; everything else (tool_result, progress, etc.) is internal REPL
 * chatter":
 *   - `stream_event` → write       (live token streaming; the server fans
 *                                    these out to viewers but does NOT
 *                                    persist them — ephemeral by design.
 *                                    Desktop doesn't send deltas, but the
 *                                    transport accepts them — ccr-stream spike)
 *   - `assistant`    → write       (whole message; persisted server-side)
 *   - `user`         → write       (the prompt + tool_results; persisted)
 *   - `system` w/ `subtype:"local_command"` → write (slash-command echo, so
 *                                    claude.ai shows locally-run /commands.
 *                                    Other system subtypes — init / status /
 *                                    compact_boundary — are NOT forwarded:
 *                                    they're local lifecycle, not transcript.
 *                                    NOTE sidecode's headless query loop
 *                                    doesn't currently emit local_command
 *                                    frames — handled for source-parity +
 *                                    forward-compat, not because we produce
 *                                    them yet.)
 *   - `result`       → sendResult()(turn boundary — claude.ai stops its
 *                                    "working" spinner. NEVER write() the
 *                                    result frame: sendResult already emits
 *                                    one, writing it too would duplicate it
 *                                    and the cloud UI spins — the gotcha
 *                                    from spikes/ccr-perm)
 *   - everything else (compact_boundary, other system subtypes, hooks) →
 *     IGNORED. Compaction is explicitly excluded by Desktop too
 *     (isCompactSummary / compact_boundary are local-only, not cloud
 *     transcript) — this is permanent, not a TODO.
