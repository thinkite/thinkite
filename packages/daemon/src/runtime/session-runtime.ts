 * Per-session in-memory state for streaming/live messaging. Holds:
 *   - a ring buffer of events the daemon has pushed (for replay on subscribe)
 *   - a monotonic cursor assigned on each addEvent
 *   - a set of live subscriber callbacks (for fanout)
 *   - a slot for the SDK Query handle (populated by F2's run-query)
 *   - in-memory settled snapshot (refreshed at turn boundaries by run-query)
 *     so subscribe-time cold path can serve atomically from memory instead
 *     of racing with the live event stream over an async JSONL read
 *
 * Generic over `T` so callers can store whatever payload type makes sense
 * (TimelineItem delta, raw SDK message, etc.). F1 stays decoupled from the
 * SDK — only shapes the data + lifecycle.
 *
 * Buffer semantics:
 *   - cursors start at 1; `sinceCursor: 0` means "replay everything"
 *   - `subscribe(cb, sinceCursor=0)` synchronously replays buffered events
 *     with `cursor > sinceCursor`, then keeps cb in the subscriber set
 *   - if the requested `sinceCursor` is older than `oldestCursor`, caller
 *     is responsible for filling the gap from settled state (JSONL on disk
 *     via getSessionMessages) — runtime only guarantees what's in the ring
 *   - bufferCap defaults to 500 events
 *
 * Settled semantics:
 *   - `settled` is null until something populates it: either run-query's
 *     turn-boundary refresh (after each `result` envelope) or a lazy
 *     cold-path init from the router's subscribe handler.
 *   - `settledCursor` is the cursor that `settled` corresponds to — i.e.
 *     replay of buffer events with cursor > settledCursor reconstructs
 *     state from settled onward. Set atomically with `settled`.
 *   - The settled snapshot is for OUR own runtime's session. For sessions
 *     replayed from disk (no SDK loop running here), settled stays null
 *     and cold path always reads JSONL fresh.

   * Arm the idle-teardown timer iff ALL eligibility predicates hold:
   *   1. `activity === "idle"` (not mid-turn)
   *   2. `subscribers.size === 0` (no iOS watcher to keep warm) — M3.7.5
   *   3. `query !== null` (something to actually dispose)
   *
   * Returns true iff arm succeeded. Used by both `setActivity("idle")`
   * (turn-complete edge) AND `unsubscribe()` (last-sub-left edge) — same
   * predicate, two trigger points. Idempotent: re-arming over an
   * already-armed timer just resets the clock (intentional — most-recent
   * idle edge wins).
   *
   * The fire callback: log + `disposeQuery()`. Reads `lastActivityAt` at
   * fire time (not arm time) so the log accurately reports the actual
   * idle duration — useful when a sub-leave-triggered arm fires long
   * after the last turn (`idleDurationMs ≈ readingTime + delay`). Since
   * setActivity stamps lastActivityAt on BOTH running and idle edges,
   * but the timer only arms after an idle edge, the stamp at fire time
   * still corresponds to the idle-entry timestamp — no contamination
   * from earlier running edges in the same turn.
