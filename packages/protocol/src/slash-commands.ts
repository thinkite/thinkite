/**
 * Slash-command whitelist for sidecode V0.
 *
 * Single source of truth for which `/command` strings the iOS picker
 * surfaces and which ones the daemon accepts via `sendPrompt`. Living
 * in protocol/ means the two sides can't drift — version mismatch is
 * caught by the existing `isProtocolCompatible` semver gate.
 *
 * V0 policy is intentionally tight:
 *   - Picker shows ONLY commands in this map, filtered by context
 *     (new-session vs in-session)
 *   - `/foo` not in this map → iOS rejects pre-send with a toast,
 *     daemon rejects with an `error` envelope as defense-in-depth.
 *   - No fall-through to "treat unknown /foo as prompt text" (Claude
 *     Code does fall through; sidecode deliberately doesn't). See
 *     sidecodeapp/sidecode#10 for the trade-off discussion.
 *
 * Per-command `handling`:
 *
 *   - `passthrough`: iOS sends the literal `/cmd args` string via
 *     `sendPrompt`; daemon forwards to the SDK which executes it
 *     natively. Used for `/init`, `/review`, `/compact`.
 *
 *   - `intercept`: iOS dispatches to a sidecode-owned RPC or local
 *     navigation INSTEAD of `sendPrompt`. Daemon's `sendPrompt`
 *     handler rejects intercept-handling commands as "client bug —
 *     should have been intercepted client-side." Used for `/clear`
 *     (navigate to new-session screen; old session left in the list)
 *     and `/model` (reuses the existing `setSessionSelection` RPC).
 *
 * V0.5+ adds `/fork`, `/rename`, `/rewind` — all intercept-handling.
 * See sidecodeapp/sidecode#10 for design notes.
 *
 * @[CLAUDE CODE COMMAND DRIFT] Claude Code ships new commands roughly
 * weekly. Sidecode is deliberately a curated subset; we don't track
 * upstream's full registry. Edit this file only when adding a
 * deliberately-supported command for V0.5+ and beyond.

 * Parse a user-input string into `{ name, args }` if it looks like a

 * surface MCP commands).
 *
 * Splitting rule: first space separates name from args; everything
 * after the first space (joined back with single spaces) is `args`.
 * Trailing whitespace is trimmed before parsing.
 *
 * Examples:
 *   "/model claude-opus-4-7"   → { name: "model",  args: "claude-opus-4-7" }
 *   "/review 123 abc"          → { name: "review", args: "123 abc" }
 *   "/init"                    → { name: "init",   args: "" }
 *   "/model claude-opus-4-7 "  → trimmed → args: "claude-opus-4-7"
 *   "hello /model x"           → null (must start with `/`)
 *   "/"                        → null (empty name)
